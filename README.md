# DataPuppy

DataPuppy is a simple CSV reader for performance and memory-efficient traversing through large CSV files with Python. It relies on couple of Python-specific concepts so author can grasp advanced pythonic features like generators, context managers and memory management. Usually you would use other libraries like Pandas, so this is just a Python programming exercise.
